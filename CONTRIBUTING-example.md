Every little bit helps, and credit will always be given.

## Ways To Contribute
There are many different ways, in which you may contribute to this project, including:

   * Opening issues by using the [issue tracker](https://link-to-issue-tracker.com), using the correct issue template for your submission.
   * Commenting and expanding on open issues.
   * Propose fixes to open issues via a pull request.

We suggest that you create an issue on GitHub before starting to work on a pull request, as this gives us a better overview, and allows us to start a conversation about the issue.
We also encourage you to separate unrelated contributions into different pull requests. This makes it easier for us to understand your individual contributions and faster at reviewing them.

2. Run the tests locally and check that they pass
3. Add yourself to ``AUTHORS.md``.

When you've been through the the checklist, push your final changes to your development branch on GitHub.

Congratulations! Your branch is now ready to be included submitted as a pull requests. Go to [project-name](link-to-repo) and use the pull request feature to submit your contribution for review.
