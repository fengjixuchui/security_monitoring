# setting-up-an-open-source-project
This repository has been created to host some common resources that'll be useful, when you're creating a new Open Source repository here at Humio.

Setting up an Open Source project is not just about making a repo public with an Open Source license, there is also a need to communicate to contributors about how we intend to do things here. This makes our work simpler and makes it easier for contributors to understand how we'd like them to contribute.

In this repository are two kinds of files:
* Those with a "-example" postfix: These need to in part be filled out by you before opening up for contributions.
* Those without the "-example" postfix: These can just be copied directly into your project as is.

The `.github` folder contains templates for issues and pull requests. By copying this folder, GitHub will create the templates for use by contributors. 

If you're not sure how to implement these, take a look at some of our other Open Source repos for examples of what they do.

Note that this repo should be seen as more of a guideline, if something doesn't fit your particular repo please feel free to change it. If you think your change could benefit everybody who uses this template, please make a PR.
